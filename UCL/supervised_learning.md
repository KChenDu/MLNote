## Supervised Learning

### Supervised approach
- stable: find sth that is not part of example
- efficient: infer in time polinomial
- robust: not sensitve to mislabell/noisy examples

### workflow
collect data -> data representation -> learning

### difdiculties
- new inputs is diff
- noise
- output is not determinissyically obtained
- input is high dim, some of which irrelevant
- how incorporate prior lnowledge?

### bayesian estimator for square loss
